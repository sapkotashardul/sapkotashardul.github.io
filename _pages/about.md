I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University, where I am advised by Professors [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Scott Delp](https://nmbl.stanford.edu/people/scott-delp/){:target="_blank"}. 

My research focuses on designing sensing systems and interfaces for health and wellbeing. I am currently working on developing new approaches to unobtrusively monitor health by understanding how people interact with their everyday environment (e.g. using computer vision to perform fall risk assessment).

<!-- I am passionate about building large-scale and accessible tools that detect and respond to subtle changes in cognitive state and social context. These technologies often enable novel applications in health, learning, and productivity. -->

Before Stanford, I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Shopee](https://shopee.sg/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked with the team responsible for training neural networks for its advertisement and recommender systems. Prior to joining Shopee, I was fortunate to have been able to study and conduct research on Human-Computer Interaction at the [NUS-HCI Lab](https://www.nus-hci.org/){:target="_blank"} with Professor Shengdong Zhao, the [Augmented Human Lab](http://www.ahlab.org/){:target="_blank"} (Auckland Bioengineering Institute) with Professor Suranga Nanayakkara, and the [Fluid Interfaces Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/){:target="_blank"} (MIT Media Lab) with [Tom√°s Vega](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vegatomas){:target="_blank"}. I received my undergraduate degree from [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}, where my thesis focused on using physiological signals to detect changes in people's attentional states in real-time.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
