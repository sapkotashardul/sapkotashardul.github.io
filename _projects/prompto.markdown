Conversational agent that provides memory training for prospective memory lapses, especially in older adults. The goal was to opportunistically provide training prompts when users would be cognitively available: during moments of lowered cognitive load or calm and idle moments, anticipating higher receptivity to learning and remembering. 

I built the Android and iOS apps for Prompto, which participants used for experiments conducted in the lab and in-situ, and assisted in the data collection and manuscript preparation. This project was led by Samantha Chan at the Augmented Human Lab. Cognitive load was detected using bio signals obtained from E4 Empatica. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and Heart rate variability (HRV) data were used. The research was published in [IMWUT 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432190){:target="_blank"}.
