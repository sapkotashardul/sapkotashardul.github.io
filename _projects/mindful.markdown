Final year undergraduate thesis. I wanted to personalize the online learning experience for MOOCs. The goal was to develop a system that would detect periods of low attention span when a person is watching a video and create review content/quiz questions from those timestamps. 

I conceptualized, designed, implemented, and evaluated the system to detect moment-to-moment fluctuation in sustained attention in real-time using a novel psychophysical task. While previous works averaged sensor readings over several seconds to classify attentional states, we were able to classify changes in attentional state at 800ms intervals with up to 81% accuracy using Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG) devices. 

This work was extended to a publication [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/10/3419){:target="_blank"}.
