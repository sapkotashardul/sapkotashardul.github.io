Final project for course 6.810 at MIT. We were motivated to help those recovering from leg injuries to avoid weight imbalance when walking or standing. The goal was to make an adaptive shoe which would tighten the laces upon detecting the imbalance and gradually adjust the feedback as users got better with their posture. 

An arduino nano with a motor shield connected the laces and the force sensitive resistors, which detected the pressure. The tightness of the laces and the actuation sensitivity could be adjusted for each user.
